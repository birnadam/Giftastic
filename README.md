# Giftastic

Giftastic is an app that populates the page with Gifs from Giphy. 
My specific page has the theme of basketball players.

The page is preloaded with clickable buttons of players, upon click, the page makes a request to 
<br>**Giphy's API** and populates the respective player's gifs onto the page underneath the buttons.

Towards the right hand side of the buttons is a form area where the user can input their own player name.
<br>Once the user hits submit a new button appears next to the preset buttons. 
<br>Which the user can click and reveal those gifs as well.

## How it was made?
Used HTML, CSS, Javascript, and jQuery to create the page.

## What integrations?
Made an AJAX call to Giphy to query for the appropriate gif and append it onto the page for the user to see.
